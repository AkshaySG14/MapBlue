# MapBlue
iOS app meant to help guide University of Michigan students within buildings

Map Blue is an iOS app built in Swift that provides an electronic map and directions for University of Michigan students to navigate through several of the more confusing buildings on campus. As a first year ENGR 100 project, Map Blue was a team effort whose contributors were University of Michigan engineers Nadya Barghouty, James Jiang, Akshay Subramaniam, and Sharon Sun. 

Originally intended as a way for both the coding and non-coding inclined members of the team to produce a useful tool for Michigan students while learning new and exciting technologies, Map Blue makes extensive use of Dijkstra’s algorithm as a way to produce the shortest path between a student's given location and his or her destination. Although there are better, more complicated algorithms such as A*, the team chose to utilize Dijkstra’s as a way to learn how to develop and truly utilize pathfinding algorithms to assist students. Overall, the project served as an excellent way to both introduce and hone the team's skills in the development and architecture of software that actual end users will utilize. 

Due to the deadlines and time constraints of the project, Map Blue only succeeded in providing directions and electronic maps for the EECS building, which was commonly referred to by engineering students as the most difficult building to navigate in.
